# About Me

Welcome to my Data Analyst portfolio! I bring over a decade of industry experience from the UK, where I've worn multiple hats in roles such as database analyst, software tester, and business analyst. Armed with a Master's degree in Computer Science, my proficiency spans various tools and technologies, including Excel, Power BI, SQL, Python, and more. I'm passionate about data analysis and its power to reveal insights, and I'm ready to share my mock projects that highlight my diverse skill set and my ability to extract valuable insights from data.
